[ Image showing my "finalization" of my first draft of my main and backup tools ](https://github.com/matthewg7679/apcsa-freedom-project/assets/145606579/c6f8c6da-d37c-4f46-9da0-f9e0b17ef907)

Basically, the first draft of my tools was set and stone to be submitted but then some changes need to be made for my main tool . 
The main issue I did encounter is trying to find a balance between having fun, and having the project not be too super massive like I have a lot of freetime in the world . The more massive the project of mine happens, the more likely I would have run out of time or would have burnout to do this project since I have to now consider other thing that are outside influences that shorten my free time for this project . 

I mainly, to compesate, choosed one of those massive projects and figured out a way to make sure that it is manageable at a smaller scale by simplifying the issue through making simple assumptions to this massive project . The project I originally choosed, which was massive, was basically the general idea of "recreating Minecraft from scratch" idea that I saw floating around on the internet where people who are coders actually tried to do this idea/challenge and were able to succesfully do so . 

Those main people were the cause of my inspiration to do this idea myself . This is especially since I knew from looking around by this idea that there is a whoole community of people who too(also) wanted to simply "recreate MineCraft" just like I was about to currently do . 

The general idea of "recreating Minecraft" cane be simplified by making assumptions like not doing infinite world terrain like those people I got inspired by , and making sure the size of the world is like the size of a chunk . This is the very same final idea I choosed as a ["finalized " Main Tool](https://github.com/matthewg7679/apcsa-freedom-project/blob/main/blog/entry01draftNumber2.md#main-tool--finalized--4) that I would like to choose for my Freedom Project , but sadly at this time I didn't figure out a ["finalized" way of my "Backup Tool"](https://github.com/matthewg7679/apcsa-freedom-project/blob/main/blog/entry01draftNumber2.md#backup-tool--finalized--4) in the first place during this timeline . This is because I mainly went of the [main idea/tool](https://github.com/matthewg7679/apcsa-freedom-project/blob/main/blog/entry01draftNumber2.md#main-tool--finalized--4) for my final decision as to what I can do for the Freedom Project in the first place ( more accurately, I am not confident in my memory of my [finalized idea of the backup tool](https://github.com/matthewg7679/apcsa-freedom-project/blob/main/blog/entry01draftNumber2.md#backup-tool--finalized--4) in the first place ). 

In fact, the dedicated section "[All the other ideas I had ( as planning towards my main tool and/or main project to be worked on ) [ Part 1 ] ](https://github.com/matthewg7679/apcsa-freedom-project/blob/main/blog/entry01draftNumber2.md#all-the-other-ideas-i-had--as-planning-towards-my-main-tool-andor-main-project-to-be-worked-on---part-1-)" is the same section of this Blog which contains all of my ideas that I formed during this timeline after fully setting up my Blog entreies at this same timeline . This "idea forming" in my brain  that has been left out into the paper provided by the computer is what takes up the second half of the time of this timeline , at least to my best guess as to how much time was at least took to do the "formation of ideas" for me to simply do to plan ahead of time to simply do my general idea under "specific idea" restrictions .
