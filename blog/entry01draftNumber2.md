[ Image showing my "finalization" of my first draft of my main and backup tools ](https://github.com/matthewg7679/apcsa-freedom-project/assets/145606579/c6f8c6da-d37c-4f46-9da0-f9e0b17ef907)

Basically, the first draft of my tools was set and stone to be submitted but then some changes need to be made for my main tool . 
The main issue I did encounter is trying to find a balance between having fun, and having the project not be too super massive like I have a lot of freetime in the world . The more massive the project of mine happens, the more likely I would have run out of time or would have burnout to do this project since I have to now consider other thing that are outside influences that shorten my free time for this project . 

I mainly, to compesate, choosed one of those massive projects and figured out a way to make sure that it is manageable at a smaller scale by simplifying the issue through making simple assumptions to this massive project . The project I originally choosed, which was massive, was basically the general idea of "recreating Minecraft from scratch" idea that I saw floating around on the internet where people who are coders actually tried to do this idea/challenge and were able to succesfully do so . 

Those main people were the cause of my inspiration to do this idea myself . This is especially since I knew from looking around by this idea that there is a whoole community of people who too(also) wanted to simply "recreate MineCraft" just like I was about to currently do . 

The general idea of "recreating Minecraft" cane be simplified by making assumptions like not doing infinite world terrain like those people I got inspired by , and making sure the size of the world is like the size of a chunk .
